The Project is exported in a .war file format.

You can directly import the project into your Eclipse IDE.

By default you cannot import .war files.
You need to download the required plugins.

In Eclipse IDE --> Help --> Eclipse Marketplace

I have uploaded the Screenshot of the installed Plugins or you can type .war in the
eclipse marketplace search box and download your desired plugin.

The steps to import the project are also uploaded.

Refer the Project Report for detailed explaination of the project.

This is a basic Store Management DBMS, you can make changes and add more features/queries.

Optional: I used Bootstrap Studio to create the UI.
